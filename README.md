# FedAvg-Learning
Git repository for a FedAvg learning algorithm implementation and analysis.

The goal is to implement the Federated Average learning algorithm through a simulation, where the user can have control on the number of clients and their data distribution in terms of heterogeneity.
Since the alogorithm shines the most on data domains where privacy is an relevant constraint, it is implemented on a custom CNN already used for a medical images multiclassification task.
