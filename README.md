# FedAvg-Learning
Git repository for a FedAvg learning algorithm implementation and analysis.

The goal is to implement the Federated Average learning algorithm through a simulation, where the user can have control on the number of clients and their data distribution, in terms of sample size and heterogeneity.

Since the algorithm shines the most on data domains where privacy is a relevant constraint, it is implemented on a custom CNN already used for a medical images multiclassification task.\
**FedAvg_save.ipynb** is the latest version of the work, the algorithm is almost ready and now I need to refine it to get some final results in different configurations.
